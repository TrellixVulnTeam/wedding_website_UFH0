                            <h3>Our Story</h3>
                            <p class="storyBlurb" style="width:1000px; text-align:left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson and Emma met at the Ping-Pong table in the fall of 2012 during soccer preseason. They quickly began to spend a lot of time together. Jackson was notably shy and terrible at initiating things, and if he was left to his own devices, well, they may never have gotten together. Luckily Emma was strong and confident enough to initiate their hang outs as well, and it was in this manner Jackson and Emma grew very close. During this period of courtship, Emma suffered a serious concussion playing soccer, and was forced to withdraw from her classes. Jackson took it upon himself to read to Emma in her dorm room, as Emma was unable to do anything except rest. <br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After asking Emma to be his girlfriend several times and being told to wait each time, Jackson stated that he would not ask again. And so it was, that on a fateful Friday night Emma asked Jackson out over some delicious sushi. Jackson is proud of this and loves to point it out.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson and Emma continued to date throughout college. They had lots of adventures together â€“ camping, hiking, going to concerts, and more. After graduating from Goshen College in 2015, Jackson moved to Pittsburgh for a year to work at a nonprofit with the PULSE program. It proved to be a trying year of distance for Jackson and Emma, as Jackson struggled with his job and Emma worked hard at student teaching and started her teaching career at Chandler Elementary. But Jackson and Emma had built their relationship on the rock, and the nightly phone calls, and the long car trips, and the long greyhound rides and sleep-depriving overnight Amtrak trips, and they powered through. <br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a cold, gray day in May 2016 Jackson drove out to Goshen from Pittsburgh, unbeknownst to Emma. He popped out from behind a bench and surprised the daylights out of her by proposing while playing the guitar and singing. It was truly magical.<br/> <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August of 2016 Jackson moved back to Goshen and began working at a software company called Hertzler Systems, and Emma began her first full year of teaching as a 4th grade teacher at Chandler Elementary. In late November of 2016 Jackson and Emma adopted a kitten named Roo.<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his free time Jackson likes reading, running, swimming, biking, cyclocross, cooking, and writing code. Emma likes kickboxing, biking, running, baking, playing sports, and has a mind-boggling passion for ice cream. Together, they like to hike, bike, cook, and watch movies.
